The error "Undefined array key 'title'" indicates that the 'title' key is not defined or missing in the array you are accessing. This error appears on line 124 of the JkLmA_09.php file.

To resolve this issue, make sure that the 'title' key is present in the array before trying to access it. You can use the isset() function to check if the 'title' key exists and has a value before using it.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to avoid this error:

php
Copy code

// Assuming you're trying to access the 'title' key on line 124
if (isset($yourArray[$index]['title'])) {
    $title = $yourArray[$index]['title'];
    // Rest of your code for using the $title variable
} else {
    echo "Title is not defined for this array element.";
}
Replace $yourArray with the actual variable name you're using to access the array that generates this error. By wrapping this block of code in an if (isset(...)) condition, you can ensure that the 'title' key exists before accessing it.

Make sure to review your code and update the line number accordingly to where the error occurs.
