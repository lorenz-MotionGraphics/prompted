Sure! I can help you write a full HTML page with a responsive design and an iframe that links to Google.

Here's an example code for a responsive HTML page with an iframe:

html
Copy code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        /* CSS for responsive design */
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
        iframe {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100vh;
            border: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe src="https://www.google.com"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
Here's a breakdown of the code:

The meta tag is used to set the character encoding and viewport settings.
The CSS style is embedded within the head section to ensure proper layout and responsiveness.
The body tag contains the iframe element, which specifies the src attribute as https://www.google.com. This will display Google inside the iframe.
The CSS code in the <style> tag ensures that the iframe takes up the entire width and height of the viewport (100% and 100vh, respectively), and removes any border from the iframe.

You can save the code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the responsive page with the Google iframe embedded.

Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.

I apologize for the inconvenience. The error message indicates that Google has set the X-Frame-Options header to 'sameorigin', which prevents it from being displayed within an iframe on a different origin (domain).

Unfortunately, you cannot embed Google directly in an iframe on your own webpage due to this restriction. Google has specific policies in place to prevent being loaded within iframes on external sites for security reasons.

If you want to embed a website within an iframe, please provide another website that allows framing or consider using another method like opening the link in a new window or redirecting the user to the desired website.

okay for now i fixed mine, but i want user to go to indexed.html not index.html by default

To make your website open the indexed.html file by default instead of index.html, you can modify the index.html file to redirect the user to indexed.html. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using JavaScript:

html
Copy code

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    window.location.href = "indexed.html";
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Redirecting...</h1>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the JavaScript code window.location.href = "indexed.html"; redirects the user to indexed.html as soon as the index.html file is loaded.

Save this code in a file named index.html, and when a user opens your website, they will be automatically redirected to indexed.html. Make sure both of these HTML files are placed in the same directory within your project.
